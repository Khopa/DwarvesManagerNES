============================

This is a demake of my Android game "Dwarves Manager" for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and was an entry for the Ludum Dare Game Jam 29.

How to play :
-------------
- Load the .nes rom in your favorite NES emulator
- Use A to dig
- Use select to switch through your dwarves
- Maintain B to run
- Avoid the fireballs and get as much gold as you can

This project uses Shiru's Neslib NES library, and an example project was used as startup code.
More information about NES programming and tutorials on Shiru's website : http://shiru.untergrund.net

**How to compile:**
Download CC65 compiler from ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/ and see/modify _compile.bat according to your path settings.
CC65 v2.13.3 must be used. Do not use a more recent version.

Sound effects and Music are not by me but from one of Shiru's example projects.

History :
---------

The original Ludum Dare game jam entry had no sounds nor music, and a very glitchy collision system that only worked once in while.
The biggest issues have now been fixed in the new version... 6 years later.
